1) Return httpd process
  to return the number of httpd process we can run this command:

    ps aux | grep "httpd"  | awk '{sum1 +=$3}; END {print sum1}'

  the result is:

   >> 10

2.) Change the file extension from *.txt to *.dat we simply run this code in the terminal
  
  for file in mig33/inner.folder/*.txt; do mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.dat"; done
